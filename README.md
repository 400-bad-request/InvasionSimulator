# Invasion Simulator

## Description

Invasion Simulator is an educational application created to test and visualize different methods of position determination, based on RSSI. In our application we simulate case when three antennas located in different places, emirate signal picked by the robot. The robot does not know the position of the antennas or its own. Based on the distribution of signals on the board, the robot must decide whether it is located inside the triangle formed by the antenna. The application allows you to visualize the distribution of signal strength in the form of a heat map as well as separate visualization of individual methods.
